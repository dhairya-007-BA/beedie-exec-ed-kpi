This repository contains code developed to support KPI tracking, data organization, and performance analysis for a continuing education organization. The primary objective of this project is to transform fragmented program, enrollment, and operations data into a unified structure that enables accurate, consistent reporting and insights. The scripts included focus on cleaning raw data, merging datasets, mapping key performance metrics, and preparing the groundwork for automated dashboard reporting.

As part of a broader KPI implementation initiative, this work also contributes to building a reliable historical data foundation for future system integration. The code helps streamline data validation, identify gaps in available records, and improve visibility into program performance, student engagement, and operational health. These efforts support informed decision-making, resource planning, and long-term strategic development.

To respect organizational confidentiality, all data and entity names in this repository have been anonymized or replaced with placeholder values. Technologies used include Python (pandas, openpyxl) for data manipulation and analysis, with Git for version control. This project reflects real-world business analyst work and demonstrates best practices in data preparation, metric alignment, and collaborative project development within a multi-stakeholder environment.
